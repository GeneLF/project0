    <div class="abouthead">about me:</div>
    <div class="abouttext">A two-time Region IX Symphony Orchestra Concertmaster, Gene Chang is legit only relevant if you live
      in north Houston. He is still trying to get his name out to all of Houston and eventually the state, nation, and world by
      practicing very hard. Gene is also the principal 2nd violin of the Houston Youth Symphony's Philharmonia Orchestra and plays
      in the absolute sh*ttiest chamber group ever (Well maybe just the first violin). He also occasionally does a piano trio with
      his boys (Lishore and Adam) and just gets pissed off at Lishore in rehearsals. Gene is also the assistant concertmaster of 
      Houston's Chinese Orchestra, a community Orchestra with both adults and students in it. Gene is also in his High School's top 
      orchestra, and aspires to make it into the top group of Texas's All State Orchestras. Gene also used to do math competitions  
      but that's super irrelevant now as the kids that live in Sugar Land are too sweaty in math and have 0 life or social skills whatsoever.

    <div class="abouttext">
      In his free time, Gene enjoys playing only one game (Minecraft) and bullying (teasing) his friends on discord and other social
      medias. He also likes watching a lot of YouTube and playing Basketball.
